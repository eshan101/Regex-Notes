Let's take a closer look at the intermediate regular expression (regex) concepts. These are more advanced than the beginner concepts and will allow you to craft more powerful and flexible regex patterns. I'll explain each concept with detailed examples and syntax.
---

 1. Grouping and Capturing
   Grouping is used to organize parts of a regex pattern and capture the matched text. Parentheses `()` are used to create groups.
   - Syntax: (pattern)
     
   - Example 1: (abc)+    
     - This matches one or more repetitions of the sequence "abc". 
     - In the string `"abcabcabc"`, the entire match is "abcabcabc", and the group captures "abc".

   - Example 2: (a|b)c   
     - This matches either "ac" or "bc".

   Capturing Groups:  
   You can reference the captured groups in some languages using backreferences like `\1`, `\2`, etc.
   Example: (\d{3})-(\d{2})-(\d{4})
   
   - Matches a string like "123-45-6789" and captures:
     - `\1`: "123"
     - `\2`: "45"
     - `\3`: "6789"
---


 2. Non-capturing Groups
   Non-capturing groups allow you to group parts of a regex without saving the matched part for later use. This improves performance when you don’t need to capture.
   - Syntax: (?:pattern)
     
   - Example:     (?:abc)+    
     - Matches "abc" one or more times, but the group is not captured.
   - Use case: When you want to group things but don’t need to save the match for future reference.
---


 3. Alternation (OR logic)
   Alternation allows you to specify multiple possible matches. It uses the pipe symbol `|` to represent "or".
   - Syntax: pattern1|pattern2
     
   - Example:     cat|dog    
   - Matches either "cat" or "dog".

   - Example with grouping: (cat|dog)s?
     - Matches "cat", "cats", "dog", or "dogs".
---


 4. Boundaries
   Boundaries are used to define positions between characters, rather than the characters themselves.
   - Word Boundary `\b`:  
     Matches the position between a word character (`\w`) and a non-word character.
     - Syntax:     \bpattern\b
       
     - Example: \bcat\b
       - Matches "cat" as a whole word, but not "catalog" or "scattered".

   - Non-word Boundary `\B`:  
     Matches the position between two word characters or two non-word characters.
     - Syntax:     \Bpattern\B
       
     - Example: 
       \Bcat\B
       - Matches "catalog" but not "cat".

 5. Lookahead and Lookbehind (Zero-width Assertions)
   Lookahead and lookbehind are used to assert that a certain pattern either follows (lookahead) or precedes (lookbehind) another pattern without including it in the match.
# Lookahead
   - Asserts that a pattern is followed by another pattern, but the second pattern is not part of the match.
   - Syntax: pattern(?=lookahead)
     
   - Example:     \d{3}(?=-)  
     - Matches three digits only if they are followed by a hyphen `-`. In "123-456", it matches "123" but not "456".

# Negative Lookahead
   - Asserts that a pattern is *not* followed by another pattern.
   - Syntax: pattern(?!negative_lookahead)
     
   - Example: \d{3}(?!-)
     - Matches three digits only if they are *not* followed by a hyphen.

# Lookbehind
   - Asserts that a pattern is preceded by another pattern, but the preceding pattern is not part of the match.
   - Syntax: (?<=lookbehind)pattern
     
   - Example: (?<=\$)\d+
     - Matches a sequence of digits only if preceded by a dollar sign (`$`). In "$100", it matches "100".

# Negative Lookbehind
   - Asserts that a pattern is *not* preceded by another pattern.
   - Syntax: (?<!negative_lookbehind)pattern
     
   - Example: (?<!\$)\d+
     - Matches a sequence of digits only if not preceded by a dollar sign.
---


 6. Greedy vs Lazy Matching
   Greedy matching tries to match as much text as possible, while lazy matching tries to match as little text as possible.
   - Greedy Quantifiers: .*  
     - This matches as much text as possible.

   - Lazy Quantifiers: .*?
     - This matches as little text as possible.

   Example:
   - Given the string: `"abc123xyz"`, the regex:
     
     With greedy matching: a.*z
          - Greedy match: `"abc123xyz"`

     With lazy matching:  a.*?z
          - Lazy match: `"abc123z"`

 7. Flags/Modifiers
   Flags modify the behavior of a regex and can be used to enable specific modes.
   - Common flags:
     - `i` (case-insensitive): Makes the match case-insensitive.
     - `g` (global): Finds all matches, not just the first.
     - `m` (multiline): Makes `^` and `$` match at the beginning and end of each line, not just the start and end of the entire string.
   Syntax:
   - Flags are typically placed after the regex in many languages:
     
     /pattern/flags
     
   Example: /cat/i
   - Matches "cat", "Cat", "CAT", etc.

   Multiline Example:
   - Consider the string:
     cat
     dog
     bird
     
     The regex `^cat` with the `m` flag:
     
     /^cat/m
     
     - Matches "cat" at the start of the string and "cat" at the start of any line in a multiline string.

 Putting It All Together
Here’s a complex regex that combines multiple intermediate concepts:

Regex:  (?<=\bcat\s)(dog|bird)(?!\sfish)

- Explanation:
   - `(?<=\bcat\s)`: Looks for "cat" followed by a space but does not include "cat" in the match.
   - `(dog|bird)`: Matches either "dog" or "bird".
   - `(?!\sfish)`: Ensures the match is not followed by " fish".

Example Match:
- In the string `"cat dog fish cat bird"`, the regex matches "dog" and "bird", but only when they are preceded by "cat" and not followed by "fish".

These intermediate regex concepts give you the ability to craft more powerful expressions, allowing you to capture, match, and organize complex patterns in your text. Once you’re comfortable with these, you’ll be ready for advanced regex topics like recursion, backreferences, and performance optimization.
