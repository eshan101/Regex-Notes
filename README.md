# Regex Notes

Here’s a structured roadmap to help you learn regex (regular expressions) from beginner to advanced, guiding you through each phase until you're able to write complex regex patterns.

---

### **Beginner Level: Core Concepts**

1. **What is Regex?**
2. **Literal Characters**
3. **Meta-characters**
4. **Character Classes**
5. **Quantifiers**
6. **Escaping Special Characters**
7. **Anchors**

---

### **Intermediate Level: Building Efficiency**

1. **Grouping and Capturing**  
2. **Non-capturing Groups**  
3. **Alternation**  
4. **Boundaries**
5. **Lookahead and Lookbehind (Zero-width Assertions)**
6. **Greedy vs Lazy Matching**  
7. **Flags/Modifiers**  

---

### **Advanced Level: Mastery and Industry-level Patterns**

1. **Recursive Patterns**  
2. **Backreferences**  
3. **Conditionals in Regex**  
4. **Unicode and Extended Character Sets**  
5. **POSIX Character Classes**  
6. **Atomic Groups**  
7. **Advanced Lookahead/Lookbehind**  
8. **Regex Performance Optimization**  
9. **Regex in Different Languages/Tools**  
10. **Creating Industry-level Solutions**
    - **Validation Patterns**
    - **Search Algorithms**
11. **Regex Debugging Tools**

### **Project and Practice**

- Build projects using regex to parse text, validate inputs, and filter large data efficiently.
- Regularly practice by writing complex validation and parsing patterns.

By mastering these topics step by step, you will gradually move toward creating complex, high-performance regex patterns like those used in large-scale applications such as YouTube’s search algorithms.
